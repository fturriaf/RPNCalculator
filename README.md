A straightforward and lightweight RPN calculator. It's not scientific but a classic, simple calculator for those who love RPN behavior.<br>

A few useful shortcuts:<br>
· C = Clear all RPN stack<br>
· S = Swap the last two values in the RPN stack<br>
· D = Duplicate the last value in the RPN stack<br>
· I = 1/X the last value in the RPN stack<br>
· P or Backspace = Delete the last value in the RPN stack<br>
· Command-Z = Undo the last operation<br>
· -> = Decrease decimal places in the whole RPN stack<br>
· <- = Increase decimal places in the entire RPN stack<br>

I would love to hear any feedback.<br>
