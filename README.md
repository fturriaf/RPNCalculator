An extremely simple and lightweight RPN Calculator. Not scientific, a classic, simple calculator for those who love RPN behavior.
Few useful shorcuts:
C = Clear all RPN Stack
S = Swap last two values in the RPN Stack
D = Duplicate last value in the RPN Stack
I = 1/X the last value in the RPN Stack
P or Backspace = delete last value in the RPN Stack
Command-Z = Undo last operation
-> = decrease decimal places in the whole RPN Stack
<- = increase decimal places in the whole RPN Stack

Love to hear any feedback
