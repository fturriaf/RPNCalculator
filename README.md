An extremely simple and lightweight RPN calculator. It's not scientific but rather a classic, simple calculator for those who love RPN behavior.
A few useful shortcuts:
C = Clear all RPN stack
S = Swap the last two values in the RPN stack
D = Duplicate the last value in the RPN stack
I = 1/X the last value in the RPN stack
P or Backspace = Delete the last value in the RPN stack
Command-Z = Undo the last operation
-> = Decrease decimal places in the whole RPN stack
<- = Increase decimal places in the entire RPN stack

I would love to hear any feedback.
